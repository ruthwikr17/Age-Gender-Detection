**Age and Gender Detection**


**Description** <br>
A real-time age and gender detection system built using OpenCV DNN with Caffe pre-trained models. The project includes a Tkinter GUI for easy interaction, allowing users to either use the webcam or upload an image for prediction. 


**Features** <br>
•	Face detection using OpenCV DNN. <br>
•	Age & gender prediction with Caffe pre-trained models. <br>
•	Tkinter-based GUI for user-friendly interaction. <br>
•	Support for image upload or live webcam feed. 


**Tech Stack** <br>
•	Python 3 <br>
•	OpenCV (DNN module) <br>
•	Caffe models (age & gender) <br>
•	NumPy <br>
•	Tkinter (GUI)

**Future Work** <br>
•	**Custom Model Training**: Train the age and gender models on a larger, more diverse dataset to improve accuracy and adapt to different ethnicities, lighting conditions, and facial features. <br>
•	**Modern Model Integration**: Replace Caffe models with advanced architectures such as YOLOv8, RetinaFace, or InsightFace for faster and more accurate face detection. <br>
•	**Emotion Recognition**: Extend the system to detect facial emotions alongside age and gender for richer demographic analysis. <br>
•	**Edge Device Optimization**: Optimize models for deployment on Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or mobile devices to enable offline, low-power operation. <br>
•	**Multi-Face Tracking**: Add multi-face tracking for analyzing multiple people simultaneously in live video feeds.
