**Age and Gender Detection**

**Description**
A real-time age and gender detection system built using OpenCV DNN with Caffe pre-trained models. The project includes a Tkinter GUI for easy interaction, allowing users to either use the webcam or upload an image for prediction.

**Features**
•	Face detection using OpenCV DNN.
•	Age & gender prediction with Caffe pre-trained models.
•	Tkinter-based GUI for user-friendly interaction.
•	Support for image upload or live webcam feed.

**Tech Stack**
•	Python 3
•	OpenCV (DNN module)
•	Caffe models (age & gender)
•	NumPy
•	Tkinter (GUI)

**Future Work**
•	Custom Model Training: Train the age and gender models on a larger, more diverse dataset to improve accuracy and adapt to different ethnicities, lighting conditions, and facial features.
•	Modern Model Integration: Replace Caffe models with advanced architectures such as YOLOv8, RetinaFace, or InsightFace for faster and more accurate face detection.
•	Emotion Recognition: Extend the system to detect facial emotions alongside age and gender for richer demographic analysis.
•	Edge Device Optimization: Optimize models for deployment on Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or mobile devices to enable offline, low-power operation.
•	Multi-Face Tracking: Add multi-face tracking for analyzing multiple people simultaneously in live video feeds.
